### 👋 About  
I’m a Canadian-born architect and software developer studying **Architecture** and **Computer Science** at the **University of North Carolina at Charlotte**.  

My work moves between the physical and the digital — from designing architectural spaces and user interfaces to building data-driven applications and interactive worlds.  
I’m drawn to projects that combine **clarity, emotion, and technology** into meaningful design.
